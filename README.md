# Dashboard
#This was my project at Denver International Airport that spanned between Business Technology and Revenue Management teams. 
#I built Power BI dashboards to measure traffic flow of passengers and flights.
#The goal was to analyze passenger and revenue data to provide strategic recommendations to Concessionaires.
#This project directly impacted the decisions or outcomes of the concourse expansion at DEN.
